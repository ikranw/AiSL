## Project: 
We are building an ASL learning tool. A user types an English sentence, our system changes it to ASL (GLOSS) grammar, and a 3D avatar in Unity signs it. Our goal is clear, correct ASL—not word‑for‑word English. We will ask ASL‑fluent people for feedback so we can improve the accuracy and clarity of the signs.
