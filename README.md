# AiSl

## Project: 
We are building an ASL learning tool. A user types an English sentence, our system changes it to ASL (GLOSS) grammar, and a 3D avatar in Unity signs it. Our goal is clear, correct ASL—not word‑for‑word English. We will ask ASL‑fluent people for feedback so we can improve the accuracy and clarity of the signs.

### Project Abstract:
AiSL is an innovative AI-powered American Sign Language (ASL) learning tool designed to support accessible and culturally respectful language learning. The platform uses natural language processing (NLP) to convert English sentences into ASL grammar, then displays the translation through a 3D avatar built in Unity. By emphasizing accurate grammar rather than direct translation, AiSL enhances linguistic understanding, inclusion, and cross-cultural communication. Learners can use playback controls to adjust speed, loop signs, and download practice materials. Developed in collaboration with the Deaf community, AiSL aims to bridge communication gaps and promote equitable, technology-driven education for diverse users.
