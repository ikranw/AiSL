# What Makes AiSL Stand Out?

We want AiSL to be different from the ASL apps already out there. To do that, we looked at what currently exists and what those apps don’t do well. From that, we figured out what we can improve and what new features we can bring to the table.

## Why AiSL Is Different

Most ASL apps fall into two groups:

### 1. Interpreter-Focused Apps
These apps try to translate ASL ↔ English in real time.  
To work properly, they need:
- Webcam tracking  
- Hand and body movement detection  
- Facial expression tracking  
- Lots of training data

**Problems with these apps:**
- They’re hard to build and maintain  
- Very time-consuming  
- Inaccurate a lot of the time  
- Super sensitive to lighting, camera quality, distance, etc.  
- Not realistic for a Senior Design timeline

Because of that, we’re choosing **not** to build a two-way interpreter. It’s too big of a project and not reliable enough.

## AiSL’s Approach: A Learner-Focused ASL App

Instead of trying to be an interpreter, AiSL focuses on people who are *learning* ASL.

### What makes this helpful?
- Easier to build accurately  
- More educational and practical  
- Less pressure to “interpret” perfectly  
- Lets us focus on helping users understand ASL grammar and signs

### ASL Grammar Transformation (One of Our Biggest Features)
Most ASL apps don’t fix English grammar to ASL grammar. They just show signs for English words.

AiSL uses an LLM to:
- Turn English sentences into correct ASL sentence structure  
- Show learners the difference between English vs. ASL grammar  
- Teach how ASL actually works, not just how to sign individual words

### 3D Avatar That Signs the Sentence
Instead of videos or pictures, AiSL will have a 3D avatar that signs the full ASL sentence.

Users can:
- Watch the signing in real time  
- Replay and slow it down  
- See the movement more clearly than a flat image or video  

### Show Meanings While the Avatar Signs
As the avatar is signing, the app can highlight or explain:
- What the sign means  
- Any useful context  
- Variations if they exist  

This helps people understand *why* something is signed a certain way.

### Feedback From the ASL Club
We want to talk to people in the ASL Club and possibly ASL instructors so we can:
- Check our grammar  
- Make sure the signs look correct  
- Hear what real learners wish existed  
- Get feedback early on

This makes the app more realistic and helpful.
