## Goal of Demo
Showcase an ASL-learning tool with basic functionality demonstrating English-to-ASL conversion and/or beginner-level ASL learning interactions.

**Demo Date:** April ?, 2026

## Tech Stack  
**Frontend:** TBD  
**Backend:** TBD

## Idea #1: English → ASL Signing Avatar  
A resource that translates English sentences into ASL structure using an LLM, retrieves appropriate signs from a database, and animates a 3D avatar to perform the signs.

### High-Level Flow


### Technology Behind the Scenes
- **LLM:** Handles English-to-ASL grammar transformation  
- **Database:** Stores individual sign animations or motion data  
- **3D Avatar Engine:**  
  - Unity  
  - VR (optional or future expansion)  
- **Code Logic:** Maps transformed ASL sentence to appropriate sign animations  

### Challenges / Open Questions
- How does the avatar know which signs to perform?  
- Do we manually code or map each sign?  
- What technology stack best supports 3D signing animation?  
- Will we need API keys?  
- How do we integrate all components together—Docker or another orchestration method?  

### Next Steps
- Research similar ASL avatar/translation projects.  
- Ikran will speak with professors familiar with VR technologies.  
- Explore how to design a curated sign database compatible with Unity.

## Condensed Concept Statement
An interactive ASL learning tool that converts English sentences into ASL grammar using an LLM and plays them using a real-time 3D signing avatar powered by a curated sign database in Unity/VR.

## Idea #2: Duolingo-Style ASL App (Beginner Level)
A learning tool centered on vocabulary learning with visual sign demonstrations and quizzes.

### Possible Features
- Beginner ASL topics (e.g., **colors**)  
- Video demonstrations of each sign  
- Quizzes to test recognition  
- Simple streak or progress tracking  
- Optional: integrate hand-motion detection  
  - Map hand gestures to keyboard functions  
  - Explore accessibility use cases for mobile disability assistance
