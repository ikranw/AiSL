For my senior design project, I am working with my team to build an ASL learning tool that turns typed English into clear, accurate ASL signed by a 3D avatar. From my coursework, I bring background in areas like algorithms, databases, graphics, and software testing, but most of my practical skills come from my co-ops, where I dealt with APIs, automated pipelines, and shipped production features. Those experiences trained me to connect services, test thoroughly, and write maintainable code, all of which I will apply to building the pipeline that links an LLM, a sign glossary, and an animated avatar. I am especially motivated by the opportunity to make technology more inclusive, and I see this project as a way to combine my technical foundation with a meaningful impact in accessibility and education.

Most of my technical experience comes from my co-ops, where I worked directly with codebases, tools, and real development teams. Through these roles I gained hands-on skills with Python, C#, Git, Docker, and frontend/backend systems. I also learned how to test software, work in agile teams, and deliver features under deadlines. My courses add the theoretical background that supports this work. Theory of Formal Languages & Automata gave me insight into how languages can be represented and processed. Software Test & Quality Assurance reinforced the importance of structured testing. Databases and Data Structures taught me how to organize and retrieve information efficiently, while AI and Algorithms trained me in problem-solving and optimization.

My co-ops gave me the most relevant preparation for this project. At 84.51, I built internal portals and APIs, learning to design flexible systems and manage documentation across teams. These. At JPMorgan Chase, I planned and began to automate a large-scale AWS data pipeline, which taught me to optimize for speed and accuracy. At Siemens, I built a LangChain chatbot, gaining experience in prompt engineering and error analysis, directly relevant to glossing and evaluating sign clarity. Finally, at Google, I shipped production features in Google Meet, reinforcing habits of writing high-quality code, testing thoroughly, and collaborating through reviews. These experiences taught me to scope MVPs, de-risk unknowns early, and deliver reliable, user-focused systems all these are important principles that will shape our application.

I am motivated by the opportunity to support inclusive education and to respect ASL as a rich language with its own grammar rather than a one‑to‑one mapping from English words. The project aligns with my interests in learning new technology and making an impact in the real world. I am excited to collaborate with teammates who bring complementary strengths across LLMs, linguistics, and real‑time graphics. I also recognize the ethical responsibility to avoid oversimplification and to involve ASL‑fluent reviewers so that our tool reinforces accurate language, not shortcuts. We plan to document limitations, be transparent about model behavior, and provide links to authoritative learning resources. This combination of impact, technical challenge, and community engagement sustains my enthusiasm for the work ahead.

Our plan has four parts: (1) a text box for English input; (2) an LLM that rewrites sentences into ASL gloss with timing hints; (3) a mapper that connects glosses to signs and non-manual markers, and (4) a Unity avatar that signs them smoothly. We’ll link these pieces with a small backend and Docker, and test different prompts and rules with feature flags. Since we are new to building apps and using some of these tools, the design may change as we go. Our first goal is a demo that signs 50–100 classroom sentences. ASL-fluent reviewers will check accuracy, focusing on gloss quality and learner understanding. I’ll measure success by meeting milestones, writing clear, tested code, and helping deliver a tool that learners find useful.
