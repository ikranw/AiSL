# Senior Design Project – Individual Contribution

**AiSL** is an American Sign Language (ASL) learning tool. This tool is powered by artificial intelligence, using a text-to-text natural language processor (NLP) to convert an American English user input’s grammar into ASL grammar. The tool then uses a database of English words as signed in ASL. The user interface built through Unity projects an avatar demonstrating the translation. Most ASL learning tools are based on direct translations from English grammar. Our goal is clear, correct ASL, not word-for-word English. We collaborate with the ASL Club on campus to interview both ASL-fluent people and aspiring learners for feedback to improve the accuracy and usability of the deliverable.

My coursework in computer science has given me a solid technical foundation to contribute significantly to this project. In *CS2023: Python Programming* and *CS2028C: Data Structures*, I gained experience developing efficient programs and working with algorithms capable of handling large data sets, which are essential skills for managing our word and sign database. *CS4092: Database Design/Development* provided hands-on experience in designing relational databases, which can be used when structuring the ASL lexicon and linking words to their signs. *EECE3093C: Software Engineering* taught me about the software development lifecycle and emphasized the importance of collaboration, version control, and testing, as well as how these practices are crucial for project organization and ensuring our deliverables are strong. Currently, *CS5167: User Interface I* is guiding me in creating intuitive and accessible user interfaces, which will be key to making our Unity avatar easy to use and engaging. Lastly, *EECE5136: Intelligent Systems* introduced me to AI principles, helping me understand how NLP models work and how to approach training or integrating them effectively into our tool. Together, these courses have built a strong technical background and an appreciation for usability and accessibility that I will directly apply to AiSL.

My co-op and research experiences have shaped both my technical and non-technical skills, preparing me for the collaborative and innovative nature of this project. As a Workshop Instructor & Program Coordinator at the UC Science & Engineering Libraries, I taught Python, MATLAB, and GitHub workshops to students and faculty, honing my ability to communicate complex technical topics clearly, a skill I utilize when designing an intuitive user experience for learners with diverse skill levels. I also developed asynchronous workshop modules, which taught me how to create flexible, scalable learning resources, a mindset I bring into designing AiSL as a tool that learners can use at their own pace. During my time as a Software Research & Development Co-op at Siemens Digital Industries Software, I worked with transformer models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), which gave me experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and an understanding of how to optimize model performance. Additionally, although not a co-op, my time as a Student Researcher with Advancement & Transition Services allowed me to work on improving accessibility for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities through the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools. This experience deepened my commitment to building solutions that prioritize inclusivity and accessibility. These roles collectively taught me technical expertise, teamwork, communication, and a user-centered approach, all of which will guide my contributions to AiSL.

I am deeply motivated to work on AiSL because it merges my technical interests with my passion for creating accessible solutions. I have long been interested in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, so the opportunity to work with large language models (LLMs) and integrate them into a real-world tool excites me. I am equally enthusiastic about using Unity to build a visually engaging avatar that demonstrates ASL grammar in a clear and helpful way. This project aligns with my personal values of equity and inclusion, as it aims to empower ASL learners and improve communication access for Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. I am also motivated by the collaborative aspect of working with my teammates and members of the ASL Club, as this will enable us to combine technical skills with lived experience to create something meaningful. The chance to develop an impactful, user-focused product that can help others is one of the most rewarding aspects of this project.

My approach to designing a solution will begin with understanding the needs of our target audience, both ASL learners and fluent signers, through interviews and feedback sessions. I will also research similar tools to identify gaps in existing solutions and look for ways AiSL can stand out by offering more accurate and culturally respectful translations. On the technical side, I will work on structuring a large database and integrating NLP models that can handle complex grammar conversions, as well as refining the Unity avatar for clarity and usability. Our final product will include a tool capable of accurately signing a wide range of sentences, allowing learners to practice and build conversational skills more quickly. To evaluate my contributions, I will measure success through user testing, aiming for positive feedback on both accuracy and ease of use, as well as meeting project milestones on time. I will know I have done a good job when our tool is intuitive, linguistically correct, and helps users feel more confident in learning ASL.
