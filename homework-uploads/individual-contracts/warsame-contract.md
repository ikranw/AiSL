My senior design project is about creating an additional resource for people learning
American Sign Language (ASL). Most of the reputable resources readily available on the
Internet are websites of teachers or interpreters signing a word at a time in a short video with a
search bar to navigate. This senior design project, named AiSL, will provide an interactive 3D
model with an input box for users. The input box will take in an English sentence or word. Then,
in the background with the help of an LLM, it will convert the English sentence into an ASL
sentence structure.The avatar will sign the ASL sentence to the user, pulling recognized words
from a database of signs. This will allow users, who are learning ASL, to see the proper
grammar structure and which signs should be used in what order.  

In my college curriculum, the courses I took that will help me prepare for the
development of this project are CS 4092 Database Design and Development, CS 2023 Python
Programming, and CS 4033 AI Principles and Applications. The Database Design and
Development course taught us how to develop a database and understand database relations.
This will help us in developing a database of signs for the avatar to sign in the project. In the
Python Programming course, we learned how to program in python. We learned fundamentals
in programming as well. This will help us in programming our project. Lastly, the AI Principles
and Applications course taught us AI fundamentals and algorithms used by AI, which will help
us understand how to use an LLM to construct ASL sentence structure from English sentence
structure.  

My co-op experiences were Cybersecurity Engineer, Business Analyst, and
Infrastructure Engineer all at Marathon Petroleum. I developed technical skills in python,
powershell, sql, and more. I developed non-technical skills like communication, teamwork,
collaboration, and more. I acquired those skills through projects, work tasks, presentations, and
being in a team. I expect to apply them in this project by working efficiently in a team and using
python and/or sql if needed. My co-op experiences will allow me to manage my time and break
down this project into deliverables on a realistic timeline.   

I am passionate about this project because it is close to home. I am a Hard-of-Hearing
individual who requires hearing aids to hear almost as well as a hearing person can. So, in high
school I took American Sign Language courses for 3 years to better understand Deaf culture
and learn how to sign. There were not a lot of resources for me to continue to develop a deeper
understanding after school, so this idea came to life. It will help ASL learners to gain more
knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of signing ASL. It will also be a free resource.
Our approach in designing a solution was understanding who the tool will be for, how the
tool will be designed, what functions it needs, and how accessible it will be. Our expected result
will have a working avatar that will be capable of signing signs in the right ASL grammar. As for
the length and amount of vocabulary it will be capable of signing, with the timeline we have, we
are leaning towards having it sign a set amount of sentences and words that will be verified by
ASL learners and teachers on campus through the ASL club on campus. We will know we are
done when the avatar is capable of signing. We know we did a good job when it signs the right
words in the right order and grammar. That is the goal of our project.
